MARGE: Oh, dear.
<span class="cn">玛姬：哦，天哪。</span>  
  
SKINNER: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider...deportation.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：辛普森先生、夫人，我们已经超出“不可救药”的范畴了。我觉得停学或开除都不够。我认为我们都应该考虑……驱逐出境。</span>

HOMER: Eh, hear him out, Marge.  
<span class="cn">荷马：唉，听他把话说完，玛姬。</span>  
  
SKINNER: Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case, I'm prepared to make a big exception. And if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：好吧，也许我有点轻率。让我解释一下。我们的小学参加一个学生交换项目。通常，学生是根据学业优秀或智力被选中，但就巴特而言，我准备破例一次。如果你愿意配合，他可以在接下来的三个月里去一个很远很远的地方学习。</span>  
  
HOMER: Sounds great. Although, a kid can't learn much in just three months.  
<span class="cn">荷马：听起来不错。虽然，孩子三个月也学不了多少。</span>  
  
MARGE: Homer, you didn't even ask where Bart would be going!  
<span class="cn">玛姬：荷马，你连巴特会去哪里都没问！</span>  
  
SKINNER: Actually, he'd be staying in France, in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：实际上，他会留在法国，在葡萄酒产区中心一座可爱的城堡里。</span>  
  
MARGE: But Bart doesn't speak French.  
<span class="cn">玛姬：但巴特不会说法语。</span>  
  
SKINNER: Oh, when he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：哦，当孩子完全沉浸在一种外语环境中时，普通孩子几周内就能变得流利。</span>  
  
HOMER: Yeah, but what about Bart?  
<span class="cn">荷马：是啊，但巴特怎么办？</span>  
  
SKINNER: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And, uh, the whole thing won't cost you a dime, as long as you're willing to take in a student of your own.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：我相信他会学到足够应付的程度。而且，只要你愿意收留一个学生，你们这次整个交流不会花你一分钱。</span>  
  
HOMER: Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam as you are?  
<span class="cn">荷马：等一下，斯金纳。我们怎么知道法国哪位校长没有像你一样骗我们？</span>  
  
SKINNER: For one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：首先，你不会得到一个法国男孩。你会得到一个阿尔巴尼亚的。</span>  
  
HOMER: You mean all white with pink eyes?  
<span class="cn">荷马：你是说全白的、粉色眼睛的那种？</span>  
  
SKINNER: No. No, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a country on the Adriatic Sea.  
<span class="cn">斯金纳：不，不，不，不。是来自阿尔巴尼亚的学生。那是一个位于亚得里亚海的国家。</span>  
  
MARGE: Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity but I think Bart should have a say in this.
