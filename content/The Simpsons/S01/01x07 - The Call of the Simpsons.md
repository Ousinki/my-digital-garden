<span class="cn">辛普森家的召唤</span>  



FADE IN:
<span class="cn">淡入：</span>  
  
We begin outside the Simpsons house, where HOMER hums as he waters flowers.  
<span class="cn">我们从辛普森家外开始，荷默一边哼着歌一边给花浇水。</span>  
  
To the left of him, BART guides a lawnmower across the yard.  
<span class="cn">在他左边，巴特在院子里推着割草机。</span>  
  
BART: Man! Rusty old hunk of junk!  
<span class="cn">巴特：天哪！这破旧生锈的玩意儿！</span>  
  
The FLANDER'S SON (ROD OR TODD) honks to Bart from the yard over. He is driving his own lawnmower as he sips a drink.  
<span class="cn">弗兰德家的儿子（罗德或托德）在隔壁院子对着巴特按喇叭。他一边喝着饮料一边开着自己的割草机。</span>  
  
FLANDER'S SON: Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for you?  
<span class="cn">弗兰德的儿子：你好，巴特。够热吧？</span>  
  
BART (grumbling): Shut up, Flanders. Hey, Dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders have?  
<span class="cn">巴特（抱怨道）：闭嘴，弗兰德斯。嘿，爸爸，为什么我们不能像弗兰德斯那样有辆体面的割草机？</span>  
  
HOMER: Just be happy with what you've got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanders.  
<span class="cn">霍默：儿子，对你已有的感到满足就好。别总想跟弗兰德斯攀比。</span>  
  
A horn honks and a large shadow looms over Homer and Bart. It is NED FLANDERS, driving a brand new trailer house / RV.  
<span class="cn">一声喇叭响起，一个巨大的身影在霍默和巴特头顶投下。是内德·弗兰德斯，开着一辆崭新的拖车屋/房车。</span>  
  
NED: How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?  
NED：
<span class="cn">辛普森，你觉得我的新车怎么样？</span>  
  
BART: Oh, wow, man! What an RV!  
BART：
<span class="cn">哇，老兄！真是一辆房车！</span>  
  
HOMER: Bart! I, uh, suppose it has various features.  
HOMER：
<span class="cn">巴特！我，呃，想它有各种功能。</span>  
  
NED: Oh, it's got everything: microwave, dish washer, big screen [TV](https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/?t=21867&sid=0b92264ca05afe8005122e5eb1b064a6#), deep fryer and oh, see up there on the roof?  
NED：
<span class="cn">哦，它应有尽有：微波炉、洗碗机、大屏电视、油炸锅，哦，看那屋顶上？</span>  
  
Homer gasps. A shiny satellite dish rests on top.  
<span class="cn">霍默倒吸一口气。一只闪亮的卫星天线竖在上面。</span>  
  
HOMER: A satellite dish!  
<span class="cn">霍默：卫星天线！</span>  
  
NED: Yes, indeedly-doodly.  
<span class="cn">内德：是的，确实确确实实。</span>  
  
HOMER: But, uh, how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while and you make only 27 dollars a week more than I do.  
<span class="cn">霍默：可是，呃，你怎么负担得起这种东西，内德？我偶尔会帮你拿邮件，你每周也只比我多赚 27 美元。</span>  
  
NED: Oh, it's simple, Simpson. Credit!  
<span class="cn">奈德：哦，很简单，辛普森。赊账！</span>  
  
HOMER: Ooh, credit!
<span class="cn">霍默：哦，赊账！</span>

A sign that says: Bob's RV Round-Up. Another sigh below that says: We'd rather make a friend...than a profit. Basically, it's a whole lot filled with loads of RV's. Homer, Bart, MARGE, LISA, and MAGGIE all walk alongside each other.  
<span class="cn">一个标牌写着：鲍勃的房车大集。下面另一行叹息写着：我们宁愿交个朋友……也不图利润。基本上，这是一个堆满了许多房车的场地。霍默、巴特、玛吉、丽莎和玛吉一起并肩走着。</span>  
  
HOMER: Ooh...aah!
<span class="cn">霍默：哦……啊！</span>  
  
A SALESMAN looks at them from a booth.  
<span class="cn">一位推销员从一个摊位里看着他们。</span>

MARGE: We're just browsing, thank you.  
<span class="cn">玛姬：我们只是随便看看，谢谢。</span>  
  
HOMER: I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?  
<span class="cn">荷默：我想看看你们最好的房车。有没有比“陆地巨兽”更好的？</span>

<span class="cn">销售员：有的。那就是“终极巨兽”。</span>

<span class="cn">荷默：在哪儿？</span>

<span class="cn">售货员：你们正站在它面前。瞧！</span>  
  
The Simpsons realize they are standing next to it. It is gigantic.  
<span class="cn">辛普森一家意识到他们正站在它旁边。它巨大无比。</span>  
  
BART: Oh, wow!
<span class="cn">巴特：哇哦！</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Would you look at this thing? Man built this. It's a vehicle.  
<span class="cn">售货员：看看这玩意儿？人造的。它是一辆交通工具。</span>  
  
BART: Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?  
<span class="cn">巴特：它有自己的卫星接收天线吗，先生？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: You can tell your son it has its own satellite. The VanStar One, launched last February, just for this thing, that's all.  
<span class="cn">推销员：你可以告诉你儿子它有自己的卫星。VanStar One，去年二月刚发射的，就为这个东西，专门的。</span>

MARGE: I'm not sure that we can afford---  
<span class="cn">玛姬：我不确定我们买得起——</span>  
  
HOMER: Does it have a deep fryer?!  
<span class="cn">霍默：它有油炸锅吗？！</span>  
  
SALESMAN: It has four of them --- one for each part of the chicken.  
<span class="cn">推销员：它有四个——每个鸡的部位一个。</span>  
  
MARGE: I don't think we can afford this, Homer.  
<span class="cn">玛琦：霍默，我想我们买不起这个。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Let's worry about that later. Come on. Let's take a tour. Want to? Come on.

The Simpsons and the salesman look inside the trailer. Everything is luxurious and well-designed.  
<span class="cn">辛普森一家和推销员走进拖车里。里面的一切都很豪华、设计精良。</span>  
  
BART: Ay, caramba!
<span class="cn">巴特：哎呀，糟糕！</span>

<span class="cn">丽莎：这比我们的房子还好。</span>  
  
HOMER: Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.  
<span class="cn">荷马：等弗兰德斯看到这个他可得惊呆了。</span>  
  
MARGE (grumbles): Seems so expensive.  
<span class="cn">玛姬（嘟囔）：看起来好贵。</span>  
  
Homer honks the horn.  
<span class="cn">荷马按喇叭。</span>  
  
HOMER: Hey! How much is it?  
<span class="cn">荷马：喂！多少钱？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: You're a man of your convict --- you just wanted to ask that and blurted it out, didn't you?  
<span class="cn">售货员：你是个被囚犯支配的人——你只是想问这个，然后脱口而出了，对吧？</span>  
  
HOMER: Yeah, how much is it?  
<span class="cn">荷默：嗯，这要多少钱？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Well, first of all, I want you to know I like your face.  
<span class="cn">推销员：首先，我得让你知道我喜欢你的长相。</span>  
  
HOMER: You do?
<span class="cn">荷默：你喜欢？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: I really do. I'm not saying that. I mean it. You got color in there. You're not Roman, are you?  
<span class="cn">推销员：真的。我不是随便说说。我是认真的。你脸色不错。你应该不是罗马人吧？</span>  
  
HOMER: No.
<span class="cn">荷默：不行。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Look like a god, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? (to rest of family). Hey, your dad's gonna just go in here, work it out, and you'll drive home in this!  
<span class="cn">推销员：看起来有点像个神。我们为什么不进信用部办办呢，宙斯？（对其他人）嘿，你们老爸就进去一会儿，弄定了，你们就开着这辆回家！</span>

The salesman and Homer sit on opposite sides of a desk and talk.  
<span class="cn">推销员和荷默坐在桌子两边交谈。</span>  
  
SALESMAN (laughs): I'm not gonna quote you a price till I check your credit rating. And let me --- I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, "Bob, is this guy good for it?", I say, "Yes.". I don't check this machine, but I don't own the place, even though's my name up there. Long story, but that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.  
<span class="cn">售货员（笑着）：在我查你信用记录之前我可不会报个价。让我把话说清楚。这只是个形式。如果你跟我说，“鲍勃，这家伙可靠吗？”，我会说，“是的。”我不查这台机器，但这地方不是我开的，尽管上面有我的名字。长话短说，这不重要。我得把它输进电脑。</span>  
  
The salesman presses Enter and suddenly, a loud siren erupts.  
<span class="cn">售货员按下回车，突然一阵刺耳的警报响起。</span>  
  
HOMER: Is that a good siren? Am I approved?  
<span class="cn">荷马：那是好的警报吗？我通过了吗？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: You ever know a siren to be good? (chuckles). No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind, telling me "Sell the vehicle to this fella and you're out of business!". That's what the siren says.  
<span class="cn">售货员：你见过哪有好警报？（轻笑）不，辛普森先生，不是好的。是坏的。那是电脑在我瞎了眼的情况下提醒我的声音，告诉我“把车卖给这家伙你就完蛋了！”。警报就是这么说的。</span>  
  
HOMER: Oh.
<span class="cn">霍默：哦。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And "wee bit" is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.  
<span class="cn">推销员：看起来终极巨兽有点超出你的预算。说“有点”是我在客气。要是你活到一百万岁也买不起这东西。</span>  
  
HOMER: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? I don't wanna go away empty handed, Bob.  
<span class="cn">霍默：你有没有不那么贵的东西？我可不想两手空空走，鲍勃。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting for ya. Perhaps I can show you something, uh...a little more you.  
<span class="cn">推销员：放轻松。别破坏我对你的这股好感。或许我可以给你看点，更适合你的东西。</span>

SALESMAN: Well, what do you think?  
<span class="cn">推销员：嗯，你们觉得怎么样？</span>  
  
The whole family groans.  
<span class="cn">全家人都发出呻吟声。</span>

SALESMAN: What'd you say?  
<span class="cn">推销员：你刚才说什么？</span>  
  
HOMER: Uh, is it used?  
<span class="cn">荷马：呃，这是二手的吧？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally. This is it for you, you know? It's this or a wagon.  
<span class="cn">推销员：辛普森先生，你再也买不到比这更好的房车了。我可不是在夸它。我是字面意思。对你来说就是这辆了，知道吗？不是它就是马车。</span>  
  
HOMER: Then, uh...how much do you want for it?  
<span class="cn">霍默：那，呃……你要这多少钱？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: This is yours. The price I'm quoting you...you're not gonna hand it to someone else? Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else. Someone else, I'm doubling this.  
<span class="cn">推销员：这是你的。我报给你的这个价……你不会拿去给别人吧？因为我要给的是你的价，不是给别人的。如果是别人，我就翻倍报价。</span>  
  
HOMER: I swear it, Bob.  
<span class="cn">霍默：我发誓，鲍勃。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: This is you and me.  
<span class="cn">推销员：就是你和我。</span>

SALESMAN: 350 a month.  
<span class="cn">售货员：每月 350。</span>  
  
HOMER: Oh, I don't know. Would it be all right if I conferred with my family?  
<span class="cn">霍默：噢，我不知道。我能和家人商量一下吗？</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Oh, Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting---see that man over there?  
<span class="cn">售货员：哦，辛普森先生，如果你得去和外面那些人商量，那我们大家都有问题。你看起来像个能做决定的人，否则我就不会——看到那边那个人了吗？</span>  
  
The salesman points.
<span class="cn">售货员指了指。</span>  
  
HOMER: Yeah.
<span class="cn">霍默：好。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: He's buying this. Did you know that?  
<span class="cn">推销员：他要买这个。你知道吗？</span>  
  
HOMER: No.
<span class="cn">霍默：不知道。</span>  
  
SALESMAN: Called me two minutes before you came in, said "Save the little one, I'm coming now." Here he is. Now you want it or not?  
<span class="cn">推销员：他在你进来前两分钟给我打电话，说“救救小家伙，我这就来。”他现在来了。你要不要？</span>  
  
HOMER: All right, all right. I'll take it!
