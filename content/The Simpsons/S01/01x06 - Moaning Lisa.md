LISA：
<span class="cn">可我不想笑。</span>  
  
MARGE: Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down. All the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties and boys will like you, and happiness will follow.  
MARGE：
<span class="cn">嗯，你内心的感受不重要，知道吗？重要的是表面呈现出来的那一面。这是我妈妈教我的。把你所有不好的感觉都往下压。一直压到膝盖以下，几乎像是在它们上面行走。然后你就能融入大家，会被邀请参加聚会，男孩子也会喜欢你，幸福就会随之而来。</span>
