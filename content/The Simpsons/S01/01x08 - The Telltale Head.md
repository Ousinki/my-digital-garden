HOMER and BART walk along a dark street at night. Bart carries some object in his hands.  
<span class="cn">霍默和巴特在夜里沿着一条黑暗的街道走着。巴特手里抱着某个物品。</span>  
  
HOMER: You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners. But I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half--  
<span class="cn">霍默：你知道，巴特，我在你这个年纪的时候，也干过几桩蠢事。但我想你会发现，只要你给别人一半——</span>  
  
They walk around a corner and Homer gasps. A wild crowd of people with torches and posterboards yell at Homer and Bart.  
<span class="cn">他们转过一个街角，霍默倒吸一口气。一群手持火把和标语牌的暴民冲着霍默和巴特喊叫。</span>

<span class="cn">荷马和巴特开始逃跑，我们清楚地看到那颗头。是杰贝迪亚·斯普林菲尔德的头。人群追着他们转了好几个街角，终于把他们逼入绝境。</span>
